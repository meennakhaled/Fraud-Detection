# Fraud-Detection
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the well-known creditcard.csv dataset containing transactions labeled as legit or fraudulent.
The model can predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, providing a simple but effective machine learning approach for fraud detection.
